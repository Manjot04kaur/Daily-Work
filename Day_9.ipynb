        "**Exception Handling**\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to respond to runtime errors, preventing the program from crashing and allowing the program to handle errors gracefully. It helps in debugging, maintaining clean code, and providing user-friendly error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Exception: An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is raised, the normal flow of the program is interrupted.\n",
        "2. Try Block: The code that might raise an exception is placed inside a try block.\n",
        "3. Except Block: The code that handles the exception is placed inside an except block.\n",
        "4. Else Block: The code inside the else block is executed if no exceptions are raised.\n",
        "5. Finally Block: The code inside the finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.\n",
        "6. Raise: Used to raise an exception manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "**File Handling**\n",
        "\n",
        "File handling is an essential aspect of programming that involves reading from and writing to files. Python provides built-in functions and modules to handle files, allowing you to create, read, write, and manipulate files in various ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "**File Methods:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* open(): Opens a file and returns a file object.\n",
        "* read(): Reads the entire content of a file.\n",
        "* readline(): Reads a single line from a file.\n",
        "* readlines(): Reads all lines from a file and returns them as a list.\n",
        "* write(): Writes a string to a file.\n",
        "* writelines(): Writes a list of strings to a file.\n",
        "* close(): Closes the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Random Module**\n",

        "\n",
        "* random.random(): Returns a random float in the range [0.0, 1.0).\n",
        "* random.randint(a, b): Returns a random integer between a and b, inclusive.\n",
        "* random.uniform(a, b): Returns a random float between a and b.\n",
        "2. Random Choices\n",
        "\n",
        "* random.choice(seq): Returns a random element from the non-empty sequence seq.\n",
        "* random.choices(population, weights=None, k=1): Returns a list of k elements chosen from population with optional weights.\n",
        "* random.sample(population, k): Returns a k-length list of unique elements chosen from population.\n",
        "3. Shuffling and Randomization\n",
        "\n",
        "* random.shuffle(lst): Shuffles the elements of list lst in place.\n",
        "* random.sample(population, k): Returns a k-length list of unique elements chosen from population.\n",
        "4. Seed Control\n",
        "\n",
        "* random.seed(a=None): Initializes the random number generator with a seed value a. Ensures reproducibility of results when the same seed is used\n",

        "**Math Module**\n",
        "\n",
